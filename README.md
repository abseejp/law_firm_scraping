# law_firm_scraping

This simple code would help you scrape the list of attornies from this site: https://www.martindale.com/search/attorneys/?term=2&sort=compositeName&sortType=DESC

If you're in Nigeria, you might need to use a VPN to access the website. The main code I wrote is in the scrape_attorney.py module.
